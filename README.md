# Gaussian-Curvature-on-Bezier-Patches

This work utilizes the Wolfram Mathematica Notebook based tool to calculate the Gaussian Curvature on Bezier patches. 

The notebook consists of functions to calculate and code to draw u-partial, v-partial, and normal vectors at the control points. 

We also calculate uv-partial, uu-partial and vv-partial, which are then used to calculate the Gaussian curvature. The example curve and contorl points are used to complete the task.

The results obtained should look as follows,
